    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>Consentless is an open source, minimalist, and pricacy preserving traffic counter. It aims to be GDPR compliant without requiring consent. It does so by tracking only impressions on URLs and not IP address or other user identifiable information. Time is tracked only to minute precision to further reduce the ability to pinpoint users with supplemental data.</p>

    <p>It can be installed on any VPS or hosted service.</p>

    <p>It can be used as your sole tracking mechanism or it can be used as supplemental tracking for visitors that did not concent to your other tracking methods.</p>

    <p>It's minimal and lightning fast. The client is four lines of JS while the server is under 50 lines of code.</p>


    <h2 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>There are three parts to counter: the client JavaScript, the server counter, and the reporting dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Client</h3>

    <p>Once you have the server configured you add the following script to the bottom of any web page to start tracking stats. This script goes just above the closing body tag.</p>

    <code>
        <pre>&lt;script src="https://counter.example.com/counter.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    </code>

    <h3>Server</h3>

    <p>Install the binary on a server, execute it, and redirect output to a file.</p>

    <h3>Reporting</h3>
