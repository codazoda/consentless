    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>Consentless is an open source, minimalist, and pricacy preserving traffic counter. It aims to be GDPR compliant without requiring consent. It does so by tracking only impressions on URLs and not IP address or other user identifiable information. Time is tracked only to minute precision to further reduce the ability to pinpoint users with supplemental data.</p>

    <p>It's designed to track impressions instead of users.</p>

    <p>It can be installed on any VPS or hosted service.</p>

    <p>It can be used as your sole tracking mechanism or it can be used as supplemental tracking for visitors that did not concent to your other tracking methods.</p>

    <p>It's minimal and lightning fast. The client is four lines of JS while the server is under 50 lines of code.</p>


    <h2 id="gettingStarted">Getting Started</h2>

    <p>There are three parts to counter: the client JavaScript, the server counter, and the reporting dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Client</h3>

    <p>Once you have the server configured you add the following script to the bottom of any web page to start tracking stats. This script goes just above the closing body tag.</p>

    <code>
        <pre>&lt;script src="https://counter.example.com/counter.js" async&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    </code>

    <h3>Server</h3>

    <p>Install the binary on a server, execute it, and redirect output to a file.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/codazoda/consentless`)</li>
        <li>Build the binary (`make`)</li>
        <li>Install (`sudo make install`)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can run consentless in a VPS or a docker container or the cloud.</p>

    <h3>Reporting</h3>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Standard Output</h2>

    <p>All CSV data, from impressions, goes to stdout. This allows you to redirect output to a file or attach stdout to a service like pub/sub.</p>

    <h3>Warning</h3>

    <p>If you pass PII in the query string parameter, or as any other part of a URL, then it will be logged. If someone else passes PII in a link to one of your URLs then you might log that.</p>
